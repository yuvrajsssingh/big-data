(1).What is Hadoop? Advantages and Disadvantages
Hadoop is an open-source framework for distributed storage and processing of large datasets using a cluster of commodity hardware.

Advantages:
Scalability: Easily scales horizontally by adding more nodes to the cluster.
Fault Tolerance: Replicates data across nodes, so failures don’t affect data availability.
Cost-Effective: Uses commodity hardware, reducing infrastructure costs.
Distributed Storage and Processing: Leverages HDFS and MapReduce for efficient data storage and processing.
Flexibility: Handles structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
Disadvantages:
Complex Setup and Maintenance: Requires expertise to set up and maintain the cluster.
Latency: Not ideal for low-latency or real-time analytics.
Data Movement Overhead: Network bottlenecks occur during data shuffling.
Single-Writer Limitation: HDFS doesn't support concurrent writes.

(2).History of Hadoop
2003-2004: Hadoop originated from the Google File System (GFS) and MapReduce papers.
2005: Doug Cutting and Mike Cafarella developed Hadoop to support Nutch (a web crawler).
2006: Yahoo! made Hadoop an open-source project.
2008: Hadoop became a top-level Apache project.

(3).What is Checkpointing in Hadoop?
Checkpointing in Hadoop creates a consistent snapshot of the NameNode's metadata in HDFS. It reduces recovery time after a failure by merging the edit logs and the filesystem image (FsImage).

(2) What is Big Data?
Big Data refers to large, complex datasets that traditional tools can't handle effectively. These datasets are characterized by:

Volume: Huge amounts of data.
Velocity: High speed of data generation.
Variety: Multiple data formats (structured, unstructured, semi-structured).
Veracity: Uncertainty in data quality.
Value: Extracting actionable insights.
(3) What is a Data Lake? Why Use It?
A data lake is a centralized repository storing raw, unstructured, semi-structured, and structured data in its native format.

Why Use It?
Flexibility: Allows storing all types of data.
Scalability: Handles large datasets.
Cost-Effective: Uses cheap storage solutions.
Advanced Analytics: Enables machine learning, AI, and real-time analytics.

(6).What is MapReduce?
MapReduce is a programming model for processing large datasets in parallel across a cluster.
Map Phase: Processes input splits and generates key-value pairs.
Reduce Phase: Aggregates and processes intermediate key-value pairs to produce the final result.
